# Pneumonia Classification from X-Ray Image using CNN

Pneumonia is a common infectious disease that is responsible for over 1 million cases and tens of thousands of deaths annually in the US alone.As an example, in 2017, 1.3 million cases were reported, of which over 50,000 died, resulting in a death rate of nearly 4%.Therefore,it is absolutely crucial to recognize a pneumonia in time as otherwise it can be life threatening.

To tackle this problem, we will use the Arizona Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset provided by the Radiological Society of North America. It consists of 26,684 X-ray images, of which about 20,000 do not show signs of pneumonia. And around 6000 actually do show signs of pneumonia. The data is quite imbalanced, which increases the challenge.
